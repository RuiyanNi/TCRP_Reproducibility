# TCRP_Reproducibility
This repository is used to reproduce the machine learning framework “translation of cellular response prediction (TCRP)” for patient derived xenografts’ (PDXs) drug-responses prediction

## Data Curation
Use scripts in data preparation and save .npy files using csv_to_npy.py

## Model training 
tcrp_train.py was used as the main training script

## Figure generation
Use scripts in results analysis

## Preprocessed data
cell line data and PDX data were included
